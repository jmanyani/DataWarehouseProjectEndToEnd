# Architecture Overview
The data architecture follows a Medallion approach with three tiers:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw CSV data exactly as it arrives from ERP and CRM sources.
Silver Layer: Cleans, standardizes, and prepares the data for analysis.
Gold Layer: Transforms data into a star schema for reporting and analytics.
