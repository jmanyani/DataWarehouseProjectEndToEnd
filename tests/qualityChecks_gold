Data Quality Validation
===============================================================================
Script Overview:
    This script runs a set of checks to verify the accuracy, consistency, 
    and reliability of the Gold Layer. The validations focus on:
    - Ensuring surrogate keys in dimension tables remain unique.
    - Confirming referential integrity between fact tables and dimensions.
    - Verifying proper relationships within the data model for reporting use.

Notes for Use:
    - Any issues flagged by these queries should be reviewed and corrected.

-- ====================================================================
-- Validation on 'gold.dim_customers'
-- ====================================================================
-- Confirm that each customer_key in gold.dim_customers is unique
-- Expected Outcome: Query should return no rows
SELECT 
    customer_key,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY customer_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- ====================================================================
-- Validation on 'gold.dim_products'
-- ====================================================================
-- Confirm that each product_key in gold.dim_products is unique
-- Expected Outcome: Query should return no rows
SELECT 
    product_key,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY product_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- ====================================================================
-- Validation on 'gold.fact_sales'
-- ====================================================================
-- Check referential links between fact_sales and its dimension tables
-- Expected Outcome: No missing keys from dimension tables
