This seems to be a continuation of the previous conversation about the GitHub README file. I'll provide a complete, formatted README.md file that you can copy and paste directly into your GitHub repository. It incorporates all the correct Markdown syntax to ensure proper rendering.

Data Warehouse Project Architecture and Design
This repository contains the architectural diagrams and data models for a sales analytics data warehouse project. The diagrams illustrate the end-to-end data flow, from source systems to the final consumption layer, following a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).

High-Level Architecture
The HighLevel_Arch_Drawio.jpg diagram provides a broad overview of the data warehouse pipeline. It outlines the three distinct layers:

Bronze Layer: This is the landing zone for raw data from source systems like CRM and ERP. The data is loaded as-is with no transformations.

Silver Layer: In this stage, raw data is cleaned, standardized, and normalized. This is where core data quality and enrichment transformations occur.

Gold Layer: This is the final, business-ready layer. Data is organized into a star schema for easy consumption by business intelligence (BI) tools, reporting dashboards, and machine learning models.

Data Flow Diagram
The DataFlow_Drawio.jpg visualizes the specific flow of data tables through the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. It shows how source tables (crm_cust_info, erp_loc_a101, etc.) are processed and eventually integrated to form the final dimensional and fact tables in the Gold layer (dim_customers, dim_products, fact_sales). This diagram provides a clear lineage of the data.

Source System Integration Mode
The IntegrationMode_Drawio.jpg diagram details the relationships between the tables in the source systems (CRM and ERP). It shows how different entities like Customer, Product, and Sales are linked. This is crucial for understanding how to join and consolidate data from multiple sources during the data integration process.

Data Mart (Star Schema)
The DataMart_Drawio.jpg diagram represents the final data model in the Gold layer. It's a classic star schema featuring:

gold.fact_sales: A central fact table that contains the sales transactions, with foreign keys (product_key, customer_key) linking to the dimensional tables. It also includes measures like sales_amount, quantity, and price.

gold.dim_customers: A dimension table containing descriptive information about customers.

gold.dim_products: A dimension table containing descriptive information about products.
